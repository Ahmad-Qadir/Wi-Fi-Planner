## 🔹 Features

- **Dynamic RSSI Calculation** – Updates instantly when AP power, frequency, distance, or wall types change.
- **Multiple Wall/Floor Types** – Supports:
  - Concrete (15 dB)
  - Plastic (5 dB)
  - Glass (7 dB)
- **Summary View** – Shows:
  - Total number of walls/floors
  - Total wall/floor loss (dB)
  - RSSI value (color-coded):
    - **Green**: Good (> -65 dBm)
    - **Orange**: Medium (-75 to -65 dBm)
    - **Red**: Weak (≤ -75 dBm)
- **Bootstrap 5 UI** – Clean, responsive, and mobile-friendly.
- **Lightweight** – Fully client-side, no backend required.
